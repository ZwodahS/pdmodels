# Overview

pdmodels is a simple model definition library that allow you to define a model that represent your python dictionary.
It does not tied itself to any database and thus will not be able to perform any relationship mapping.

It is also contained in a single file `pdmodels/__init__.py`, which if you so choose, can just copy it into your project.
However this will not include the other extensions.
